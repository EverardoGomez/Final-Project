HI 	<(^_^)>

This is my final project's code for my game dev class.

IDK what I'm gonna call this game yet, but I will explain my vision here.

The game is gonna be a mix of Hades and Ultrakill.
SO I'm thinking of a top down face paced action game like the general look of Hades with the weapon system similar to Ultrakill.

IDK how exactly I'm gonna make it but I will try to make something interesting.

p.s my code and math is gonna be awful
